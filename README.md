# Logisim_Projects
*Designed a single cycle processor, Interrupt Support, and a pipelined processor in Logisim*

### Processor
Designed a datapath of LC2200 processor in Logisim to implement a supplied instruction set architecture.

### Interrupt
Implemented a hardware support for hardware operations in Logisim and an interrupt handler in Assembly to increment a clock value at a designated memory address.

### Pipelined Processor
- Implemented a pipeleined processor that has five stages, FETCH, INSTRUCTION DECODE/REGISTER READ, EXECUTE, MEMORY, and WRITE BACK.
- Works based on LC-2200 ISA
